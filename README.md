# Coding-Challenge---16

In this challenge, I will create a Product Dashboard for a business using React and Vite. This dashboard will allow users to view a list of products, add new ones, and display product details. I will set up the environment with Vite, create components to organize the UI, and use JSX, keys, and props to pass data between components.

Business Case
Scenario: A small e-commerce business wants to build a simple Product Dashboard to manage its product listings. The dashboard should display a list of products, each with a name, price, and description. The business also wants a way to add new products. By organizing the interface into React components, the business can maintain and update the dashboard as the product line grows.

The dashboard will consist of the following components:

1.ProductList: Displays a list of products.
2.ProductItem: Shows individual product details.
3.AddProductForm: Allows users to add new products.
4.App: The main component that renders everything.
